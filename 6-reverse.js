// Good! I appreciate that you have your own approach and your solutions are original.
// It is great that you know how to use array methods like "pop" and "push"

// Please do take advantage of ES6 features and build good habits around them, this will help you a lot in real projects
// where we try to stick to good practices as much as possible.
